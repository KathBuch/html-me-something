     My name is Kathryn Buchanan. I'm a 22 year old college student, majoring in Graphic Communications. Some of my past times include stressing over my still life drawing classes and bingeing Netflix.

     I've traveled a lot, or more specificallymy family has moved a lot over my life time. I have lived in five different states, three of which were within the span of 3 years. This was the start of my online life, which threw me into the web development world.

         Although moving required me to do many things online--which of course furthered my interest in web development--it wasn't the start of my interest in coding. I actually began wanting to code video games before anything else, even prior to the constant relocating. Some of my inspiration would be indie games like Undertale and Hyperlight Drifter. To this day I still heavily consider focusing on game development over web development, but we will see where the wind takes me.
